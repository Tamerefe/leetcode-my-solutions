## Problem
[LeetCode #1680 – Concatenation of Consecutive Binary Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-consecutive-binary-numbers/)

## Language
Python

## Approach
Concatenate the binary representations of all integers from 1 to `n` into a single
binary string, convert it to an integer, and take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Complexity
